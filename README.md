  ### NixOS system flake (environment.systemPackages)

  ```nix
  {
    inputs.trueconf-flake.url = "github:sleroq/trueconf-flake";

    outputs = { self, nixpkgs, trueconf-flake, ... }:
      let
        system = "x86_64-linux";
      in {
        nixosConfigurations.my-host = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
          inherit system;
          modules = [
            {
              # Required because this package is unfree
              nixpkgs.config.allowUnfree = true;

              environment.systemPackages = [
                trueconf-flake.packages.${system}.trueconf-client
              ];
            }
          ];
        };
      };
  }
  ```

## Audio

Tested with PipeWire (PulseAudio compatibility). Should also work with
PulseAudio if it provides a Pulse socket. The wrapper uses an existing Pulse
socket and does not start a PulseAudio daemon.

## Desktop

Installs a `.desktop` entry and icons; after installation they should appear in
most desktops (e.g. GNOME/KDE) under your applications menu.
